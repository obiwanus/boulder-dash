- Redesign the camera code so it's nicer

DONE:

18.12.2019
- Look around even if the pointer has reached the edge of the window
- Hide the mouse cursor
- Figured out how to get the camera direction by using trigonometry
- Zoom by changing FOV

16.12.2019
- Walk around with camera (keep looking at the origin)
- Move dependent on delta time
- Strafe
- Look around with camera (really bad)

15.12.2019
- Move the camera around

14.12.2019
- Draw something in perspective
- Draw a rotating cube
- Draw several rotating cubes

13.12.2019
- Use 2 textures for the triangle
- Draw a rect
- Play with textures
- Rotate the rect
- Do the tranform exercises

12.12.2019
- Try using the struct generator for gl (dropped: too much work)
- Draw a textured triangle

11.12.2019
- Fixed the redrawing problem
- Adjust the vertex shader so that the triangle is upside down
- Move the triangle left and right
- Output the vertex position to the fragment shader and set as color
- Review the rust opengl tutorial for more stuff potentially
- Build my own gl crate

10.12.2019
- Draw a triangle
- Draw a coloured triangle
- Draw 2 triangles next to each other, each using different shaders and vbo/vao
- Make a basic color animation

09.12.2019
- Copy assets next to the executable on build
- Make I/O error output nicer
- Load shaders
