- Specify a horizontal offset via a uniform and move the triangle to the right side of the screen
  in the vertex shader using this offset value
- Output the vertex position to the fragment shader using the out keyword and set the fragment's
  color equal to this vertex position (see how even the vertex position values are interpolated
  across the triangle).
  Once you managed to do this; try to answer the following question: why is the bottom-left side
  of our triangle black?

DONE:

11.12.2019
- Fixed the redrawing problem
- Adjust the vertex shader so that the triangle is upside down

10.12.2019
- Draw a triangle
- Draw a coloured triangle
- Draw 2 triangles next to each other, each using different shaders and vbo/vao
- Make a basic color animation

09.12.2019
- Copy assets next to the executable on build
- Make I/O error output nicer
- Load shaders
