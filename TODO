- Load Knight Artorias

DONE:

24.12.2019
- Tried several models on the internet, with different formats: dae, fbx, gltf

23.12.2019
- Implement directional light
- At last, properly looking light attenuation
- Multiple light sources (probably buggy)

22.12.2019
- Erased Dima so I can follow the tutorials again
- Create a material in the shader
- Create a light struct in the shader
- Experiment with different light colors
- Use diffuse and specular maps

21.12.2019
- Load the Dima model and try to draw it

20.12.2019
- Ambient + diffuse lighting
- Specular lighting
- Move the light around
- Calculate lighting in view space
- Fullscreen window
- Exit on escape

19.12.2019
- Properly texture every side of the cube
- Factor textures out into a module
- Shed some light on the scene
- Draw light source
- Set uniforms in a safer way (but a bit more expensive)
- Create a buffers module

18.12.2019
- Look around even if the pointer has reached the edge of the window
- Hide the mouse cursor
- Figured out how to get the camera direction by using trigonometry
- Zoom by changing FOV
- Redesign the camera code so it's nicer
- Restrict camera movement to the xz plane
- Make a look_at method for the camera

16.12.2019
- Walk around with camera (keep looking at the origin)
- Move dependent on delta time
- Strafe
- Look around with camera (really bad)

15.12.2019
- Move the camera around

14.12.2019
- Draw something in perspective
- Draw a rotating cube
- Draw several rotating cubes

13.12.2019
- Use 2 textures for the triangle
- Draw a rect
- Play with textures
- Rotate the rect
- Do the tranform exercises

12.12.2019
- Try using the struct generator for gl (dropped: too much work)
- Draw a textured triangle

11.12.2019
- Fixed the redrawing problem
- Adjust the vertex shader so that the triangle is upside down
- Move the triangle left and right
- Output the vertex position to the fragment shader and set as color
- Review the rust opengl tutorial for more stuff potentially
- Build my own gl crate

10.12.2019
- Draw a triangle
- Draw a coloured triangle
- Draw 2 triangles next to each other, each using different shaders and vbo/vao
- Make a basic color animation

09.12.2019
- Copy assets next to the executable on build
- Make I/O error output nicer
- Load shaders
